# Simple-Clock
This is the project of making a simple clock using AVR micro-controller only.

Dealing with simple AVR microcontroller and interfacing 7segment display that too multiplexed over a single port.
This is a simple demonstration of making a clock using the pluses generated by the oscillator to the controller.

.DSN file is provided for schematic simulation of the same in proteus pro ISIS.

Star if you find this helpfull.
Thank you.
